# Homeopython
Homeopython is a full-featured multi-platform homeopathic compiler.

## How it works

Homeopython uses homeopathic principles to create a full-featured and multiplatform homeopathic compiler.

Using homeopathic principles to create a compiler brings a lot of advantages to a compiler and, just like the homeopathy, it has no collateral effects. For example, it is **impossible** the occurrence of any memory leak or segmentation fault.

The main secret for this is that Homeopython dilutes your program in several NOP (actually, `pass`) operations. We do this because we believe in the main concept that is called "NOP operation memory". According to this concept, the NOP operations remembers the other operations if they are both mixed and shaken.

This concept is based on the same concept of homeopathy, where the practitioners believe that the water "remembers" the substances mixed in it. 

As a Homeopython program has only NOP operations (with the memory of the original code, of course), the pipelining, memory usage and efficiency of the energy consumption are incredibly improved.

Homeopython can be used with **any** type of program, programming language, or computer architecture, as it has no contraindications and no collateral effects.

## Example of a *homeopythonic* program

The code below shows a simple a Hello World with Homeopython:

```python
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
```

We can also compile a very complex and advanced code with also a great ratio of code compression (just another big feature of the homeopythonic programs). Here's a trained Convolutional Neural Network with 23 layers and one hundred thousand neurons:

```python
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
```

## Scientific evidence

Unfortunately, several uninformed people wrongly argued against Homeopython, saying that Homeopython does not work and, even worse, that Homeopython is pseudo-scientific!

We have several scientific pieces of evidence that say the opposite.

First, we must say that these people are not trustworthy. These people are funded by the traditional programming industry. It is not curious that people funded by the slow and unethical traditional programming industry argue against the best, faster and lightweight compiler? Yeah, we know...

But we also have proofs. The code below was published in 1998 by PhD. Beto Velasquez, a famous homeopath, in the Brazillian Journal of Homeopathic Stuff and proves mathematically that Homeopython is Turing completeness:


```python
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
pass
```

I can also speak for myself: when I use a *homeopythonic* program I feel that my computer becomes a little faster. 

Also, several programmers that I know say that Homeopython really works.

Thus, this finally proves undoubtedly the efficiency and effectiveness of the Homeopython.

## WARNING

We recommend that you use the *homeopythonic* programs together with "traditional" programs for better results.
